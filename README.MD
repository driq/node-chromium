# node-chromium
> Chromium binaries for your NodeJS project

**node-chromium** allows you to easily add [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) binaries to your project and use it for automation, testing, web scraping or just for fun.

This is a fork of [node-chromium](https://github.com/dtolstyi/node-chromium) by Dmytro Tolstyi. This repository will follow the version numbering of the Chromium project.

## Why Chromium?
[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) is an open-source web browser developed and maintained by The Chromium Project. Google Chrome, also released in 2008, is a proprietary web browser developed and maintained by Google. The reason why Chrome and Chromium are tied to each other is that Chome borrows Chromiumâ€™s source code.  
The main benefit of using Chromium is that it **doesn't** include all the proprietary modifications made by Google, thus it's more lightweight and more suitable for automation purposes.  
You can see full list of differences in [Fossbytes article](https://fossbytes.com/difference-google-chrome-vs-chromium-browser/).

## Usage
Depending on your needs, you can install module into **devDependencies** (`--save-dev`) or production **dependencies** (`--save`)

```
npm install --save chromium
```

During the installation process **node-chromium** will find the latest suitable build for your platform, download it and extract into libraries folder. As soon as installation is finished, you are ready to use Chromium in your project:

```js
const chromium = require('chromium');
const {execFile} = require('child_process');

execFile(chromium.path, ['https://google.com'], err => {
	console.log('Hello Google!');
});
```

## Selenium WebDriver Headless (without UI) tests
It's extremely easy to use **node-chromium** with **selenium-webdriver** to perform e2e tests without spawning browser UI.
First, install all dependencies

```
npm install --save chromium chromedriver selenium-webdriver
```

After the installation is finished, create simple script that opens Google Search home page and takes it's screenshot in headless mode.

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver');
const chrome = require('selenium-webdriver/chrome');
const chromium = require('chromium');
require('chromedriver');

async function start() {

    let options = new chrome.Options();
    options.setChromeBinaryPath(chromium.path);
    options.addArguments('--headless');
    options.addArguments('--disable-gpu');
    options.addArguments('--window-size=1280,960');

    const driver = await new webdriver.Builder()
        .forBrowser('chrome')
        .setChromeOptions(options)
        .build();
		
    await driver.get('http://google.com');
    console.log('Hello Google!');
    await takeScreenshot(driver, 'google-start-page');
    
    await driver.quit();
}

async function takeScreenshot(driver, name) {
	await driver.takeScreenshot().then((data) => {
        fs.writeFileSync(name + '.png', data, 'base64');
        console.log('Screenshot is saved');
    });
}

start();
```
